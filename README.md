## ⚠️ IMPORTANT Read First
I have since changed Lone EFT DMA Radar to be **READ-ONLY** and **RADAR-ONLY**.

No feature requests in Issues please.

## 👋 Welcome
This is the original Lone EFT DMA Radar by Lone, with some key differences from the original version:
1. **Radar Only/No Memwrites.**
3. New & Improved Silk.NET/ImGui Interface.

This version is designed to be as safe as possible from any future detections, and gives you the information that you need while allowing you to fully experience the game for yourself.

## 💾 Setup
- Download the latest version in [Releases](https://github.com/lone-dma/Lone-EFT-DMA-Radar/releases).
- See our [Setup Guide](https://github.com/lone-dma/Lone-EFT-DMA-Radar/wiki/Radar-Setup-Guide).
