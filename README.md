## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT Read First
I have since changed Lone EFT DMA Radar to be **READ-ONLY** and **RADAR-ONLY**.

If you are looking for the old **FULL FEATURED** version of Lone EFT DMA, it is now being maintained by [DMA Educational Resources](https://github.com/dma-educational-resources/eft-dma-radar).

## üëã Welcome
This is the original Lone EFT DMA Radar by Lone, with some key differences from the original version:
1. **Radar Only/No Memwrites.**
2. New & Improved WPF User Interface.

This version is designed to be as safe as possible from any future detections, and gives you the information that you need while allowing you to fully experience the game for yourself.
